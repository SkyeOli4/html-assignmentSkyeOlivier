A quick little practice in HTML coding for my porfolio

I chose to do a CV/ Portfolio Page set up as I thought it could lead to really cool and interactive elements. So far I have managed to include a hyperlink to my portfolio and some information about myself in A CV format (super basically). 

I included a photo of myslef as it is a CV/profolio and The image is inluded in the download (improvement point would be to embed th file)

I really really stuggled setting up the git repository as I was jumping around in process.(my mistake)
